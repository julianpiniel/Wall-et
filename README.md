# Wall-et

Wall-et is a platform that provides an easy and quick way to send and request money online. You can transfer money (abroad) to family, friends, and online shops. We operate as a payment processor for users looking for a secure platform that offers more than just a form of identification.

Wall-et has a third-party payment service that consists of a virtual VISA prepaid card that you can use as a physical visa card.
It works like a credit card, but in order to use it you need to have your Wall-et account charged. Once the payment is made, this will be discounted to your Wall-et balance.

You can load money easily to your Wall-et account at select retailers.
 All you need to do is generate a code in your Wall-et app, and show it in the retail store along with your cash. You can usually add any amount per code.
 The money will be added to your account immediately.
